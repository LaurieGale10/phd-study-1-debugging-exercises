# phd-study-1-debugging-exercises
A collection of the five debugging exercises used for the first study of my PhD that investigated the attitudes, emotions and behaviour that lower secondary students exhibit towards debugging.

Exercises written in Python with correct and original versions (that is, the version that the student participants saw when completing the study)
