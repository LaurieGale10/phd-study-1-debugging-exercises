# Initial description
# Alex has measured out the dimensions of a cuboid to use for a science experiment. Alex has made a program to calculate the volume of the cuboid and print it to the screen. However, the program contains some errors.
# The height and depth of the cuboid are 25cm and its width is 50cm. The volume of a cuboid is calculated using the equation below:
# Volume = height x width x depth

width = 50
depth = 25
height = depth
volume = height * width * depth
print("The volume is,volume)

#Errors: Use of variable 'depth' before it has been defined (based on misconception that depth can be assigned as it wil eventually equal 25)
#Syntax error with missing quotation in print statement
