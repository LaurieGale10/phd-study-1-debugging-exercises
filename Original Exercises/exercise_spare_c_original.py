#This program is meant to add a certain value to a pair of coordinates. It inputs an x and y coordinate from the user, and then inputs a factor to multiply these by. It then prints the new coordinates. Fix the errors so that the correct output is printed.

int(input("Enter an x coordinate")) = x
int(input("Enter a y coordinate")) = y
int(input("Enter a number to increase these coordinates by")) = factor

x = x * factor
y = y * factar
print("The new coordinate is:")
print("(x,y)")

#The int(input) may be too difficult so this can be taken out
#The sentiment of the errors is incorrect assignment and incorrect print formatting


#Input age and output is as int

#Idea of taking number in and adding something
